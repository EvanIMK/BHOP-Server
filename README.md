Open-sourcing the various aspects of the IMK Bhop system. 

## SERVER
All files can be uploaded directly to your server. Although made for a Linux server, and uses SourceMod 1.11.6517 (fixes chat sound bug). 

If using a Windows server, you will need to change all the extensions. 

Files in addons/sourcemod/scripting/ contain all the code from the various plugins, many are made or customised to my liking. 

## DATABASE
Map zones and tiers database files for over 2000 maps, including all the latest and private maps. 
<br>sneaK has made a script to import the zones into an existing zones database. [Here](https://gist.github.com/sneak-it/333d8e8631d25abe37b0ac8f832fa325)

## WEB
An updated stats page that works with the latest version of BhopTimer. 

## DISCORD
Updated/private version of the IMK discord bhop bot. Requires its own hosting. 

## FastDL
http://fastdl.imkservers.com/maps

Over 1600 maps including all the latest maps and many private ports. 

Please download all files and make your own FastDL server, this one will go down eventually.
